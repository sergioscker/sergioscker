I‚Äôm a **Frontend Developer** currently living in **Portugal**, with a strong passion for technology, learning, and creating impactful digital solutions. My journey in web development began with JavaScript, and over time, I‚Äôve expanded my skills to include modern tools and frameworks that help me build efficient and scalable applications.  

I love doing different activities throughout the day and feeling like my time was well spent. My proactive attitude and curiosity fuel my growth, allowing me to embrace new challenges and consistently improve.  

I focus heavily on **Clean Coding** principles, organizing my code for maintainability and scalability. For example, I ensure modularity by separating concerns, like maintaining specific files for project colors, custom hooks, and reusable components.
