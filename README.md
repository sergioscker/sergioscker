# Hello, I’m Sérgio Oliveira 👋  

I’m a **Frontend Developer** currently living in **Portugal**, with a strong passion for technology, learning, and creating impactful digital solutions. My journey in web development began with JavaScript, and over time, I’ve expanded my skills to include modern tools and frameworks that help me build efficient and scalable applications.  

I love doing different activities throughout the day and feeling like my time was well spent. My proactive attitude and curiosity fuel my growth, allowing me to embrace new challenges and consistently improve.  

### 🌱 **What I’ve Been Working On**  

Over the past year, I’ve worked on more than **10 projects** and made close to **200 commits**, deploying solutions using platforms like **Vercel** and **AWS**. Some key highlights include:  

- **ReactJS**: Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.  
- **Next.js**: Creating modern, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.  
- **TailwindCSS**: Rapidly styling applications with utility-first CSS.  
- **Vite**: Enhancing development speed with a faster build process.  
- **TypeScript**: Writing scalable, type-safe code.  
- **Styled-Components**: Designing reusable and maintainable UI components.  

I focus heavily on **Clean Coding** principles, organizing my code for maintainability and scalability. For example, I ensure modularity by separating concerns, like maintaining specific files for project colors, custom hooks, and reusable components.
